It is a simple NxM Switch whose specification is written in Bluespec System Verilog, a high-level language for hardware designing.
The design was simulated using Bluesim and the RTL Design was generated in Verilog using the bluespec tools.
An NxM switch provides functionality to switch data from 1 of the N input ports to 1 of the M output ports.
Let the input ports be numbered 0,1,2,..., N-1, and the output ports are numbered 0,1,2,..., M-1. Input packets arrive at the switch.
Incoming data at an input de-multiplexer is routed into the appropriate destination queue. At each output port, there is an Arbiter that checks the queues that it is managing to receive the packet.
It serves the queues in a fair manner using the Round-Robin Policy. The packets in the selected queue are then sent out in their entirety, to the output port.

A Makefile is provided to run the design and generate the Verilog Code. The steps are as follows:

Run 'make bluesim' to generate the executable file. Then use the command './Tb' to run the desing generated by bluesim.
To generate the RTL code run the command 'make verilog. Installation of bluespec tools is required to generate the files.
